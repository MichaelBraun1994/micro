# Micro

Toolkit for social micro web apps.

The various components are released into the public domain.

## Boilerplate

Base files for any micro web app repository.

When creating a new micro web app, simply copy all files from `boilerplate` over to the new
repository and substitute all place holders (with curly braces, like `{name}`). Over time, extend
the files as needed with app-specific details.
